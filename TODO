 * Write README.md
 * multi config set
 * verifying that we are actually publishing proper code with sha256
 * promisification of most of the things (including the execs)
 * better error handling
 * repair init(), and make it actually usable
 * colorful output
 * (someday) use AWS SDK instead of command line tooling
